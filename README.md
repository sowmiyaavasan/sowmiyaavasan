### About me 🎧📔

I'm a Software Engineer and I love bringing great designs to life by creating responsive solutions. My specialties include quickly adapting to new technologies and learning new programming languages, problem-solving, and bringing smiles to people's faces. Some technologies I enjoy working with include **ReactJS**, **JamStack** (JavaScript, APIs and Markup). I'm currently developing my skills on **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) and enjoying every ounce of my career.
